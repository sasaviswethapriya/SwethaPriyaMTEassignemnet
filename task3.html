            formulated </td>
        <td >Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical</br>
            applications can be invented. Applications are speculative, and there may</br>
            be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions. Examples are</br>
 limited to analytic studies. </td>

            characteristic proof of</br>
            concept </td>
        <td >Active R&amp;D is initiated. This includes analytical studies and laboratory</br>
            studies to physically validate the analytical predictions of separate</br>
            elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not</br>

            technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic</br>
            supporting elements so they can be tested in a simulated environment.</br>

            TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment. Represents a major step up in a</br>
            technology\'s demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a</br>
            prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated</br>

            demonstration in an</br>
            operational environment </td>
        <td >Prototype near or at planned operational system. Represents a major step</br>
            up from TRL 6 by requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype</br>
            in an operational environment (e.g ., in an air-craft, in a vehicle, or in</br>

            conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system</br>
            development. Examples include developmental test and evaluation</br>
            (DT&amp;E) of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it</br>
            meets design specifications. </td>

            conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation</br>
